## Description:

This is a research project about applying gamification in studying. All students in the class will work on this project as subgroups. 

In order to manage the project, we will use GitHub to set the “to do”, in progress, and completed lists of tasks and to upload all artifacts. 

Phases of the project (each student will work only on a specific task in each phase): 

Reading about gamification and understanding its benefits 

Reviewing available work about applying gamification to increase students’ motivation for studying in general and for IT student’s in specific. 

Comparing different gamification approaches, and specify which approaches are applicable for the different types specialties 

Design and implement a game to motivate students to study 

Apply the game  

Write a research paper to document the work (abstract, introduction, background, related work, main section, conclusion, references) 

## Tasks:

1. create a GitHub account using your JU email address 
2. read about gamification  
3. Specify your area of interest according to your skills 
   - Reading and writing (should be very good in English) 
   - Software Development (should be very good in mobile app development) 
   - Performing analysis and comparisons (should be analytical) 
students will be devided into teams according to the table below:

## Groups:

students will be devided into subgroups according to the table below:
